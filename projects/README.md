# Data Science Projects

This directory contains documentation and links to data science projects I've completed during my education and beyond.

## Project Structure

Each project should be organized in its own subdirectory with the following structure:
- README.md - Project description, methodology, and results
- Notebooks - Jupyter notebooks with analysis
- Data - Sample data (if not too large and can be publicly shared)
- Images - Visualizations and results
- Code - Any additional code files

## Featured Projects

This section will be updated with links to my most significant data science projects.

## How to Navigate

Each project contains detailed documentation on:
- Problem statement
- Data sources
- Methodology
- Results and insights
- Technologies used
